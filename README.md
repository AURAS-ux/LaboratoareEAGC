# LaboratoareEAGC

A collection of Computer Graphics and Animation laboratory exercises implemented in C# using Silk.NET and OpenGL.

## Overview

This repository contains practical implementations for computer graphics concepts, featuring interactive applications that demonstrate fundamental rendering techniques and user interaction patterns.

## Projects

### Tema 1 - Interactive Point Renderer

An OpenGL application showcasing basic graphics programming with Silk.NET framework.

#### Features
- **Interactive Point Drawing**: Left-click to add points to the canvas
- **Multiple Render Modes**: Right-click to cycle between Points, Lines, and Polygon rendering
- **Canvas Management**: Press spacebar to clear all points
- **Real-time Rendering**: Immediate visual feedback for all interactions

#### Technical Implementation
- Modern OpenGL with VAO/VBO buffer management
- GLSL vertex and fragment shaders
- Coordinate normalization for proper screen mapping
- Dynamic vertex buffer updates for real-time interaction

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Silk.NET framework
- OpenGL-compatible graphics driver

## Getting Started
